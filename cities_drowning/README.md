# List of things to be done

- [x] Stopping the overlap between the cities.
- [ ] Will we use the actual height data?
- [ ] Tweaking the oscillations.

  * The sea textures are heavy and lowers the framerate.

- [ ] Placing a large city near the sea to start with.
- [x] Making a reset button.
- [x] Giving a CO $_2$ slider. (?)
- [ ] Getting a better colour for the cities.
- [ ] Tweaking the wave amplitudes.
        
        - [ ] Make the sea return to the same height.
